# ChainQuest Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy and run ChainQuest for the Kwala Hacker House hackathon.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Testnet tokens for deployment

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/chainquest
cd chainquest
npm run install-all
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create `.env` files in the contracts directory:

```bash
# contracts/.env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
```

### 3. Deploy Smart Contracts

Deploy to Sepolia (Ethereum testnet):
```bash
cd contracts
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

Deploy to Mumbai (Polygon testnet):
```bash
npm run deploy:mumbai
```

Deploy to BSC Testnet:
```bash
npm run deploy:bsc-testnet
```

### 4. Configure Kwala Workflows

1. Create a Kwala workspace at [kwala.com](https://kwala.com)
2. Upload the YAML files from `kwala-workflows/` directory
3. Update contract addresses in the YAML files with your deployed addresses
4. Activate the workflows in your Kwala dashboard

### 5. Start Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìã Kwala Workflow Setup

### Required Workflows
1. **Quest Automation** (`quest-automation.yaml`)
   - Monitors quest completion
   - Distributes rewards automatically
   - Generates daily quests

2. **NFT Evolution** (`nft-evolution.yaml`)
   - Tracks character experience
   - Triggers automatic evolution
   - Updates metadata across chains

3. **Cross-Chain Tournaments** (`cross-chain-tournaments.yaml`)
   - Creates tournaments automatically
   - Handles matchmaking
   - Distributes prizes

### Configuration Steps
1. Replace placeholder contract addresses (`0x...`) with your deployed addresses
2. Update RPC endpoints for your preferred providers
3. Set up webhook URLs for notifications (optional)
4. Test workflows with small transactions first

## üéÆ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Player Onboarding
1. Connect wallet to the application
2. Mint your first character (automatic via Kwala)
3. Receive welcome quest automatically
4. Complete quest and receive rewards

### Scenario 2: Character Evolution
1. Gain experience through battles/quests
2. Watch character evolve automatically when requirements are met
3. See updated stats and visual changes
4. Receive evolution bonuses

### Scenario 3: Cross-Chain Tournament
1. Register for tournament on any supported chain
2. Get matched with players from other chains
3. Battle automatically executes
4. Receive prizes on your preferred chain

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Contract Deployment Fails**
- Check you have sufficient testnet tokens
- Verify RPC URLs are correct
- Ensure private key is properly formatted

**Kwala Workflows Not Triggering**
- Verify contract addresses in YAML files
- Check event signatures match your contracts
- Ensure workflows are activated in Kwala dashboard

**Frontend Connection Issues**
- Verify you're on the correct network
- Check contract addresses in frontend config
- Ensure MetaMask is connected
